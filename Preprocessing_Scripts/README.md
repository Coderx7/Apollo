# Preprocessing scripts

1. gen_train.py - generates the training set data to a specified resolution

2. gen_test.py - generates the test set data to a specified resolution

3. gen_augment.py - generates rotations, shear and translations on the files generated by gen_train.py

4. gen_preprocess.py - generates preprocessed files from the augmented data for the training set and the test set

Note: The paths for the input and output directories must be adapted before executing the scripts. It is best to execute the scripts in the order mentioned above.
