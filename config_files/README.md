The config_files folder has the following files


1.) img_test.lst - this file is needed for creating a Kaggle submission.  You will need to replace the path with you own path to the TEST images for now.  A simple find and replace in Sublime worked for me.  Soon we should have a global fig file to take care of all of this hopefully.
